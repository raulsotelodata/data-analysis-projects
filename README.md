## Introduction
As a data analyst, I am passionate about using data to inform and improve business decisions. I have experience working with various data analysis tools and techniques, including SQL, Excel, Python, and R. My portfolio showcases my skills in data cleaning, data visualization, statistical analysis, and machine learning.

In my projects, I aim to provide insights and recommendations that can drive strategic decision-making. I have worked on projects in industries such as finance, healthcare, and e-commerce, and I am always looking for new challenges to take on.
