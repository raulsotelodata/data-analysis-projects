  <h3>Motorcycle accidents across Texas roads</h3>
  
Skills:Data Azure

Business Context: Motorcycle accidents are a significant concern for businesses that operate in the transportation industry. One way to analyze this issue is by using the CRIS TxDOT database, which contains valuable data on motorcycle accidents. By analyzing this data, businesses can gain insights into the prevalence of accidents in different cities, the gender distribution of those involved in accidents, the number of people injured, the severity of those injuries, and the most common day of the week for accidents to occur. These insights can help businesses develop strategies to minimize the risk of motorcycle accidents and protect their employees and customers. Additionally, by leveraging machine learning algorithms, businesses can predict the likelihood of motorcycle accidents in 2023 and take proactive measures to prevent them. By taking a data-driven approach to motorcycle safety, businesses can reduce the risk of accidents and promote a safer transportation environment for all.

Analytical Context: An analysis of motorcycle accidents across Texas roads can provide valuable insights into the causes and risk factors associated with these accidents. To perform this analysis, businesses can use a combination of analytical tools such as Alteryx, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, and Power BI. Alteryx can be used to prepare and clean the data, integrating data from different sources and cleaning it for analysis. Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio can then be used to upload and run SQL prompts on the data, allowing businesses to extract insights and trends from large datasets. SQL statements can also be used to import the data into Power BI, where it can be visualized using charts, graphs, and other visualizations to help businesses understand the data in a meaningful way. By leveraging these powerful analytical tools, businesses can gain a better understanding of motorcycle accidents across Texas roads and take steps to reduce the risk of accidents in the future.
