  <h3> Understanding the alternative fuel vehicles market in the US </h3>

Skills:

Business Context: You are an analyst at the ICCT (International Council on Clean Transportation (https://theicct.org/mission-history)), an NGO that provides research to environmental authorities around the world. You are part of a team that is preparing a report on the alternative fuel vehicles (AFV) market in the United States, with a particular focus on the state of Washington. Business Problem. Your job is to provide a characterization of the AFV market in the US and in Washington, including data about energy efficiency of the vehicles over time, geographical distribution, etc.

Analytical Context: You will be working with three Excel files that contain the raw data. The first one is "us_sales_fellow.xlsx", which contains aggregated sales figures for the US; the second one is "us_ranges_fellow.xlsx", which has data about ranges of electrical vehicles. These data files come from the US Department of Energy. The last one is "washington_evs_fellow.xlsx", which is a census of all the electric vehicles in circulation in Washington state. This census data comes from the Washington State Department of Licensing.

### Analyzing student grades in the Open University
Skills:

Business context: The Open University is one of the largest universities in the world by number of enrolled students. In recent years, it has been working on developing an analytics platform called OU Analyse to track student performance across its many programs, with the aim of reducing dropout and increasing student engagement and learning. Their analytics team is growing, and they have been actively looking to hire strong candidates. You have been shortlisted as one of them.

Business problem: As part of the interviewing process, you have been given an anonymized dataset and asked to compute the GPA (Grade Point Average) for all students in the October 2014 cohort and create a Tableau dashboard that includes their GPAs and demographic data.

Analytical context: You will be working with a subset of the OULA dataset, which contains demographic and assessment data for a number of UK-based students from the October 2014 cohort (coded as 2014J). The data is in the OULA.xlsx file.

### Motorcycle accidents across Texas roads
Skills:

Business Context: Motorcycle accidents are a significant concern for businesses that operate in the transportation industry. One way to analyze this issue is by using the CRIS TxDOT database, which contains valuable data on motorcycle accidents. By analyzing this data, businesses can gain insights into the prevalence of accidents in different cities, the gender distribution of those involved in accidents, the number of people injured, the severity of those injuries, and the most common day of the week for accidents to occur. These insights can help businesses develop strategies to minimize the risk of motorcycle accidents and protect their employees and customers. Additionally, by leveraging machine learning algorithms, businesses can predict the likelihood of motorcycle accidents in 2023 and take proactive measures to prevent them. By taking a data-driven approach to motorcycle safety, businesses can reduce the risk of accidents and promote a safer transportation environment for all.

Analytical Context: An analysis of motorcycle accidents across Texas roads can provide valuable insights into the causes and risk factors associated with these accidents. To perform this analysis, businesses can use a combination of analytical tools such as Alteryx, Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio, and Power BI. Alteryx can be used to prepare and clean the data, integrating data from different sources and cleaning it for analysis. Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio can then be used to upload and run SQL prompts on the data, allowing businesses to extract insights and trends from large datasets. SQL statements can also be used to import the data into Power BI, where it can be visualized using charts, graphs, and other visualizations to help businesses understand the data in a meaningful way. By leveraging these powerful analytical tools, businesses can gain a better understanding of motorcycle accidents across Texas roads and take steps to reduce the risk of accidents in the future.
