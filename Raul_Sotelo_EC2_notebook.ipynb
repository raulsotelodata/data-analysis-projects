    "[Alternative fuel vehicles (AFV)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_fuel_vehicle) are vehicles that run either partially or totally on an energy source that is not gasoline or diesel, such as ethanol, solar power, electricity, or hydrogen. Some AFVs are highly efficient and, perhaps more importantly, have reduced greenhouse gas emissions relative to traditional vehicles, which makes them an important part of environmental recovery and protection plans around the globe.\n",

    "The Light-Duty AFV Registrations pie chart shows the US market disparity when it comes to alternative fuel vehicles, with flex-fuel vehicles dominating the market at 80.64%. Yet, there is competition in the market with other fuel alternatives such as HEV (15.54%), EV (1.98%), PHEV (1.72%), and CNG (.11%). In the current AFV market, there is still a reliance on gasoline with 97.9%, FFV, HEV, and PHEV, of the market that still relying on gasoline while the other 2.1% use their fuel source. Unlike traditional gas-powered vehicles, these AFVs are more efficient and cause less harm than their counterparts, and as technology evolves this positive impact will increase. But, from the pie chart alone we can not see the impact on a large scale because the pie chart does not have the number of vehicles. The quantity is important because this could be a sample size of 20 vehicles or 20,000 but we have no way of knowing without any context.\n"

    "Read this excerpt from [this page](https://afdc.energy.gov/vehicles/flexible_fuel.html) about flexible fuel vehicles:\n",
    "\n",
    "> Flexible fuel vehicles (FFVs) have an internal combustion engine and are capable of operating on gasoline and any blend of gasoline and ethanol up to 83%. E85 (or flex fuel) is a gasoline-ethanol blend containing 51% to 83% ethanol, depending on geography and season. According to IHS Markit, as of 2017, there were more than 21 million FFVs in the United States. Because FFVs are factory made and are capable of operating on gasoline and gasoline-ethanol blends, many vehicle owners don't realize their car is an FFV and that they have a choice of fuels to use.\n",

    "    Yes, because the owner is unaware of the capabilities of their vehicle,  and they are still using regular gasoline and not utilizing the alternative fuel capabilities. The number of flex-fuel vehicles stays the same, but those using e85 may or may not be lower depending on their owner's knowledge of fuels they can use. In conclusion, the benefits of using alternative fuels may not have a positive impact due to the owner's negligence. "

    "The amount of units sold sky rocketed from 2017 to 2018 by 165,734 sales, with more than half of these sales being EV with minimal PHEV being sold. While EVs gained popularity it seems PHEVs faced less recognition and would face drops after a couple years of growth. EVs however continuously faced growth and even exploded in sales. This increase could be influenced by government programs, better advertising, or improvement in technology, more charging stations, better AI, etc. Also, it would be interesting to see how these sales compare to non-AFVs in a similar price range and the difference.

    "The gap from ~147 to ~228 miles could be multiple things that are influencing the data and visualizations. The gap in data could be due to having a small sample size of just 65 cars. Having such a small sample size can lead to biases as shown above where the data has missing information and does not show the whole picture and can lead to an incorrect analysis. Additionally, the gap could be attributed to an advancement in technology where early AFVs were limited to 125 miles on solely electric range and once the technology was developed were car manufactures able to extend the range. Alternatively, some vehicles are a hybrid and rely on both gas and electricity such as PHEVs, and HEVS and do not have the battery capacity for long distance electric ranges due to weight restrictions, battery modules take up a large amount of space and weight."

    "A majority of model's ranges stay the same throughout the years with a minority that improve their range. Most of the improvement was not seen until 2017 when manufacturers increased their ranges such as Volkswagen eGolf (+42 miles), Ford Focus (+39 miles), Nissan Leaf (+34 miles), BMW i3 (+17 miles),Tesla Model X (+8 miles) and Tesla Model S (+2 miles). Additionally, in 2017 manufactures released new models such as Tesla Model 3 (310 miles), Hundai Ioniq (124 miles), Honda Clarity (89 miles), and Chevorlet Bolt EV (238 miles). But, there were also those models that lost range such as smart fortwo (-10 miles), Mitsubishi iMiEV (-4 miles), and Fiat 500 (-3 miles). There were also those models that had no improvement such as Mercedes B (87 miles), Honda Fit EV (82 miles), Toyota Rav4 EV (103 miles), Kia Soul EV (93 miles), Chevrolet Spark EV (82 miles). Also, there were two models that were only produced for one year, Scion IQ (38 miles) and Transit Connect E (56 miles). In conclusion, newer cars do not necessarily have longer ranges as seen in the data, there are a lot of variables when considering range and can not base a conclusion solely on year."
